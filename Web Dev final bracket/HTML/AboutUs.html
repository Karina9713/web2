                    <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
                    <p>Founded by Canadian environmentalist Lisa Christensen in 2000, Hong Kong Cleanup began with a one-day beach cleanup event. Under Lisa's leadership, participation has increased by an average of 65% annually, making it the foremost cleanup organization in the region.</p>
                        
                    <p class="highlight">We have engaged over 1,000,000 participants and removed over 11,000,000 kilograms of trash.</p>
                        
                    <p>Hong Kong Cleanup operates as a community, offering a year-long education platform that collaborates with companies, schools, government entities, and individuals to provide practical solutions for sustainable living every day of the year.</p>
                    
                    <h1>What we offer?</h1>
                    <p>Throughout the year, we host managed cleanup events for corporations seeking meaningful team-building experiences with their employees. We are the first and favorite organisation in Hong Kong providing this service. 
                        
                    <p class="highlight">We are the official coordinator of the global cleanup movement for Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup and Let’s Do It! World Cleanup, sanctioned by UNEP.</p>
                    
                    <p>Committed to making a positive impact. Recently, we have also become the official #TeamSeas partner for the region, leading free weekly events for individuals and families, aiming for transformative change in our oceans and the communities and wildlife that rely on them.</p>
                    
                    <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
                    <p>More than two decades of data and volunteer feedback have highlighted the urgent need for increased community involvement and action. Trash poses a serious threat to the health of our oceans, coastlines, country parks, economy, and people. It pervades every corner and will persist unless we alter our habits. Our missions are-</p>
                    
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Empowering Hong Kong citizens to actively safeguard our coastal areas, country parks, and city streets by keeping them clean and free of trash.</li>
                      <li>Raising awareness and fostering understanding that communities play a crucial role in shaping attitudes towards environmental protection.</li>
                      <li>Inspiring positive change in waste management, littering, pollution, and promoting enhanced public-private cooperation to reduce waste production in Hong Kong.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="highlight">Our ultimate vision is a future where cleanups are no longer necessary. We aspire to raise awareness and drive change to significantly reduce trash generation and prevent any waste from polluting our natural ecosystems.</p>
